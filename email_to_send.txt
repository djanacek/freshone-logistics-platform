Subject: URGENT: Route Optimization API Completely Ignoring Vehicle Constraints - Safety/Legal Issue

Dear NextBillion.ai Support Team,

We have a CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE with your Route Optimization API v2 that is creating unsafe and illegal routes.

IMMEDIATE PROBLEM:
Your API is returning routes with:
- 38, 38, and 37 stops per vehicle
- Estimated 28+ hours per route  
- Complete violation of USDOT Hours of Service regulations (11 hour max)

OUR CONSTRAINTS (BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED):
We've set strict limits that the API is ignoring:
- max_travel_time: 21600 (6 hours)
- time_window: 8 hours maximum
- Max 6 stops per vehicle
- 35 vehicles available
- Break requirements
- Return to depot requirements

The API is assigning 6x more stops than our limit and creating impossible routes.

COMPANY INFO:
- Company: FreshOne
- API Key: 9431912d013c4c23930daa935e4db91e
- Use Case: Food distribution logistics
- Urgency: PRODUCTION BLOCKING

CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
1. Why is max_travel_time being completely ignored?
2. What are the correct parameter names for time constraints?
3. How do we enforce USDOT Hours of Service compliance?
4. Is there a different API endpoint for time-constrained routing?

WHAT WE'VE TRIED:
- Multiple API payload formats
- Different constraint parameters  
- Increased fleet size
- Various optimization objectives
- NOTHING works - API assigns 37-38 stops per vehicle regardless of constraints

WHAT WE NEED:
Routes with:
- Maximum 6-8 stops per vehicle
- Maximum 8-11 hours total time
- USDOT compliant breaks
- Multiple short routes instead of impossible long ones

TIMELINE:
This is blocking our production deployment. We need:
- Immediate response on correct parameter format
- Working example of time-constrained optimization
- Phone call if needed to resolve quickly

Please treat this as URGENT - we cannot deploy routes that violate federal safety regulations.

The current API behavior suggests our constraints aren't being processed at all. We're willing to upgrade to a premium tier if that provides better constraint enforcement.
